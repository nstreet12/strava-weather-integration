Project Name: Strava Weather Integration
========================================

Description
-----------

This project integrates Strava activities with real-time weather data, enabling users to see weather conditions at the time of their activities. When a new activity is logged in Strava, the AWS Lambda function is triggered, fetching weather data from the Open-Meteo API and appending it as a comment to the Strava activity.

Components
----------

-   **AWS Lambda**: Hosts the Python function that is executed in response to event triggers.
-   **API Gateway**: Manages the incoming requests to the Lambda function, acting as a "front door" for requests.
-   **AWS IAM**: Manages access control by providing the Lambda function with necessary execution permissions.
-   **Strava API**: Provides access to user activities.
-   **Open-Meteo API**: Supplies weather data.

Functional Overview
-------------------

1.  **Event Trigger**:

    -   The process starts when a new activity is recorded in Strava, which triggers the webhook configured via Strava API.
2.  **Lambda Invocation**:

    -   Strava webhook events invoke the AWS Lambda function through the API Gateway endpoint.
3.  **Data Fetching**:

    -   Lambda function extracts the activity details and queries the Open-Meteo API to fetch weather data for the time and location of the activity.
4.  **Data Processing**:

    -   The weather data is processed and formatted within the Lambda function.
5.  **Post to Strava**:

    -   Finally, the Lambda function posts the formatted weather data back to the Strava activity as a comment.


Data Flow
---------

1.  **Activity Data**:

    -   Received from Strava containing details like activity ID, user ID, start time, and location.
2.  **Weather Data**:

    -   Contains weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed at the time of the activity.
3.  **Processed Data**:

    -   Combines activity and weather data to enhance user experience on Strava.

Benefits
--------

-   **User Engagement**: Enhances user interaction with Strava by providing contextual weather information.
-   **Automation**: Automates the process of logging weather data without user intervention.
-   **Scalability**: Utilizes AWS Lambda for scalable, on-demand processing power to handle varying loads.

Further Development
-------------------

Potential areas for expansion include:

-   **Historical Weather Data**: Fetch historical weather data for past activities.
-   **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize the type of weather information they receive.
-   **Analytics**: Integrate more detailed analytics for users to track performance against weather conditions.
